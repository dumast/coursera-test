	<h1 id="python">My Python experience</h1>

	<p>10/05/2020: Python is the first programming language I have ever learned. My computer science teacher introduced it to me during class in 7th grade, and I just simply loved the concept. I have learned the basics of the arithmetics as well as making loops, if statements. That is pretty much what I have learned so far in this language, and I do intent do increase my knowledge in this language. I have done some small projects, as a calculator, a dice, rock-papers-cisors, and I have done a small adventure game (text only) with my friend.</p>

	<h1 id="c">My C experience</h1>

	<p>10/05/2020: C is the second language I have gotten in to, by following a course from Dartmouth and IMT on edx. I have chosen to learn this language as most of other programmation languages are based on C, like Java, C++, C#, and plenty of more. Just as in Python, I  have learned basic arithmetics as well as loops, if statements, and arrays. </p>

	<h1 id="htmlcssjs">My HTML, CSS and JavaScipt experience</h1>

	<p>10/05/2020: I already have some basic experience in HTML as I tried to make a website for the Aerospace Club at my school. After that, I didn't really do anything much in this language until I joined the HackClub, where learning front-end development is quite needed.</p>
